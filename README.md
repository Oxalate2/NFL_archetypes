# NFL_archetypes üèà

## Project Overview

The **NFL_archetypes** project aims to leverage **machine learning** techniques and **clustering** algorithms to categorize NFL players into distinct **playstyles** or "archetypes." The goal is to identify and group players based on their on-field behavior and performance metrics, allowing for a deeper understanding of player traits, comparisons, and potentially predicting player performance in future games or seasons.

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to analyze various performance statistics, metrics, and player characteristics to generate meaningful clusters or archetypes. These archetypes could be used by coaches, analysts, and teams to make data-driven decisions regarding player acquisitions, matchups, and strategic planning.

## Key Features üîë

- **Player Clustering**: Grouping NFL players based on their performance data using unsupervised machine learning techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).
- **Playstyle Archetypes**: Identifying common playstyles such as "Speedster", "Power Runner", "Elite Passer", etc.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing clusters to make it easier to interpret player archetypes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Utilizes various player statistics such as rushing yards, passing efficiency, blocking success, speed, and more.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides insights into player comparisons, and potential strengths/weaknesses for strategy development.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`
  
### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oxalate2/NFL_archetypes.git
cd NFL_archetypes
```

## Data üìä

The project uses NFL player performance data (either pulled from publicly available datasets or APIs). For optimal results, the dataset should include a variety of performance metrics for players, including:

- **Offensive Stats**: Yards gained, touchdowns, completions, rushing attempts, etc.
- **Defensive Stats**: Tackles, interceptions, sacks, etc.
- **Advanced Metrics**: Speed, agility scores, yards per carry, passer rating, etc.
- **Physical Traits**: Height, weight, age, position, etc.

### Data Source
- [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)

## Usage

### Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

The first step is to gather and clean the player data. Ensure that missing values are handled and that all relevant features are extracted from the dataset. This can include statistical summaries like rushing yards per game or passing accuracy.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your player data (make sure to replace this with your actual file path)
data = pd.read_csv('player_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, normalization)
data_cleaned = preprocess_data(data)
```
